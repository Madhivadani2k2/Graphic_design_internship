Graphic Design Intern at Oasis Infobyte ðŸŽ¨

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I completed four design-focused tasks, gaining hands-on experience with diverse graphic design projects:
* Digital Posters & Flyers: Created visually compelling designs for marketing campaigns, learning scaling and layout techniques.
* Magazine & Brochure Design: Developed print media layouts, integrating elements like typography, photography, and advertising.
* Business Cards: Crafted business cards that reflected brand identity through typography and design.
* Infographics: Designed data-driven visuals with tools like Canva and Venngage, focusing on effective storytelling and impactful presentation.
 This experience enhanced my design skills and exposed me to various tools and design principles. Excited to apply these skills in future projects!
